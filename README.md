# uWSGI Flask Demo

So this is a tiny app, we use uWSGI to set it up.

In theory you can easily reproduce this on an M1 laptop:


1. Get yourself an M1 macbook/mini

2. Get yourself some [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)

3. Go get yourself some [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/)

4. [optionally] Go get yourself some [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk)

5. Run `make build-amd64`

```shell
github.com/flyinprogrammer/uwsgi-flask-demo via üêç v3.10.2 
‚ùØ make build-amd64                 
docker buildx build --load --platform linux/amd64 -t flyinprogrammer/uwsgi-flask-demo:amd64 .

=> => naming to docker.io/flyinprogrammer/uwsgi-flask-demo:amd64  0.0s 

```

6. Run `make run-amd64`

7. Watch the logs show socket 0 are full because something is sad.

```shell

This is the sad:

Who is hurting our little socket?

8. Watch this problem go away with:

```shell
make build-arm64
make run-arm64
```

* Be confused and amazed anything in this world works.
* Schedule time to have an exetentional crisis about "What is a thread?".

9. Iterate on combinations of configurations because you're a monkey and curious.
Then establish a crude pattern that the issue seems to be related to something about
the `master = true` and that the stats server requires `master = true` to spawn. Also
no combination of `processes` and `threads` seemed to have any impact this.

10. Get your hands on a _real_ linux computer because life is spectacular these day.
Then run a public version of this image, and notice the error only exists on top
of the qemu emulation bits. :shrug:

```shell
docker run --init --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 flyinprogrammer/uwsgi-flask-demo:amd64
```

11. Look for friends on The Internet to help because I am dumb and perhaps they have
some easy answers rather than loosing my life to figuring how to debug this with
gdb or something. :shrug:


# Notes

## Docker Tags

I know Docker and other CLI tools don't require architecture as part of the tags, it just
seemed to make things easier when testing locally. It also seems impossible to inspect
architecture at runtime other than `docker top <conainer name>` and see `/usr/bin/qemu-x86_64`
in front of all your processes :sparkles: magic :sparkles:.

## wrk

I optionally install and used wrk to figure out if maybe adding load would help or hurt things.
So far it seems like there's nothing to write home about other than, "qemu is slow" which
is hilarious because "qemu" is actually the 8th Wonder in the world.
